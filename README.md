# MerzLWC
- This project involves an LWC named displayShippingStatus and the related controller class - GetMerzShippingDetails.
- The LWC makes a callout to the merz sandbox endpoint in the wire function and gets a string from the rest endpoint in the Merz org.
- This string is then displayed to the user in the LWC HTML.
